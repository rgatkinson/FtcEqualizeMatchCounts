# FtcEqualizeMatchCounts

## Summary
``FtcEqualizeMatchCounts`` is a tool for editing the database used by the [First Tech Challenge ScoreKeeper software](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/scorekeeper) so as that at the start of a League Tournament all teams have the same number of averaging matches accrued from prior League Meets. The tool does this by adding never-played Equalization Matches to the event schedule as necessary. After importign the edited database back into ScoreKeeper, these Equalization Matches need to be manually scored as Wins for Blue.
